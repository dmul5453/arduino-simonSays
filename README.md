Simon says game with buzzer



Special thanks to this blog for inspiring this project https://www.duinobit.com/projects/my-bootleg-simon-game-arduino-mini-project-and-tutorial/

A lot of my simonSays.ino borrows from the code he provides there.

The VCC files provided are used to assist with randomness. I use the time it takes to sense a fluncuation in the VCC to change the randomSeed, suggested to me by this reddit comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/ArduinoProjects/comments/xcywab/comment/iobf1wg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
